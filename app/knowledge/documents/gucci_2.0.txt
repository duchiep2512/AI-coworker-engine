SIMULATION: Gucci Group — HRM Talent & Leadership Development 2.0

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 1: COMPANY OVERVIEW & GROUP DNA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Gucci Group is a global luxury conglomerate operating nine iconic fashion and luxury brands.
Each brand maintains a high degree of autonomy in creative direction, brand identity, and
regional operations. The Group's mission is to nurture world-class luxury brands while
fostering synergies across the portfolio.

Group DNA Pillars:
- Excellence in Craftsmanship: Every brand upholds the highest standards of artisan quality.
- Creative Autonomy: Each brand has the freedom to define its own creative vision and identity.
- Heritage & Innovation: Balancing respect for brand history with forward-looking innovation.
- Sustainable Luxury: Commitment to responsible sourcing, ethical labor, and environmental stewardship.

The CEO firmly believes that standardization should never come at the cost of brand identity.
Group-level initiatives must "support, not impose." The tension between operational efficiency
(shared services, talent mobility) and brand uniqueness is the central strategic challenge.

Brand Autonomy vs. Group Needs:
- Each brand has its own CEO, creative director, and regional leadership.
- Group HR provides frameworks and tools, but brands decide how to adapt and implement.
- Inter-brand talent mobility is encouraged but never forced.
- The Group DNA is a unifying "north star," not a rigid set of rules.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2: GROUP HR MISSION & COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Group HR Mission (CHRO's Mandate):
(a) Identify and develop high-potential talent across all nine brands.
(b) Increase inter-brand mobility — enabling leaders to gain cross-brand experience.
(c) Support (not impose on) brand DNA — any Group HR initiative must respect brand identity.

The Competency Framework — Four Pillars:

1. VISION
   - Junior Level: Understands the brand's market position and can articulate short-term goals.
   - Mid Level: Translates brand strategy into team-level objectives; anticipates market shifts.
   - Senior Level: Shapes long-term brand and Group strategy; inspires others with a compelling future state.

2. ENTREPRENEURSHIP
   - Junior Level: Takes initiative on assigned projects; proposes small improvements.
   - Mid Level: Identifies new business opportunities; takes calculated risks with accountability.
   - Senior Level: Drives transformational change; builds new business models or enters new markets.

3. PASSION
   - Junior Level: Shows genuine enthusiasm for the brand and luxury industry.
   - Mid Level: Inspires team members; acts as a brand ambassador internally and externally.
   - Senior Level: Embodies the brand's soul; creates an emotional connection with stakeholders.

4. TRUST
   - Junior Level: Delivers on commitments; communicates transparently with immediate team.
   - Mid Level: Builds trust across functions; handles confidential information with integrity.
   - Senior Level: Earns trust of the Board and external partners; role-models ethical leadership.

Use Cases for the Competency Framework:
- Recruitment: Competency-based interview guides for each level.
- Annual Appraisal: 360° feedback mapped to the four pillars.
- Development: Individual Development Plans (IDPs) linked to competency gaps.
- Mobility: Cross-brand rotation criteria based on demonstrated competencies.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 3: 360° FEEDBACK & COACHING PROGRAM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Program Design:
- Rater Groups: Self, Manager, Peers (min 3), Direct Reports (min 2), Cross-brand Stakeholder (1).
- Scale: 5-point behavioral frequency scale (Never → Always).
- Items: 8 items per competency theme = 32 total items + 4 open-ended questions.
- Anonymity: All rater responses are anonymized except Manager feedback.
- Language Coverage: English, French, Italian, Mandarin, Japanese.

Participant Journey:
1. Week 1: Communication & briefing (email + town hall).
2. Week 2-3: Rater nomination and consent collection (GDPR-compliant).
3. Week 4-5: Survey window opens — reminders at Day 5 and Day 10.
4. Week 6: Reports generated; individual debriefs scheduled.
5. Week 7-8: Coaching sessions begin (3-session arc: Reflect → Plan → Commit).

Coaching Program:
- Coach Profile: ICF-certified, luxury industry experience preferred, culturally sensitive.
- Session Cadence: 3 sessions over 6 weeks (90 min each).
- Goals-to-Habits Plan: Each coachee leaves with 2-3 micro-habits tied to competency gaps.

Vendor Considerations:
- Build vs Buy: Core platform built in-house (to protect brand data); 360° survey tool licensed.
- Benchmarking: External benchmarks from CCL (Center for Creative Leadership) and Korn Ferry.
- Data Security: All data stored in EU data centers; SOC 2 Type II compliance required.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 4: REGIONAL ROLLOUT — EUROPE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Current Status (Europe Region):
- 4 out of 9 brands have piloted the competency framework informally.
- France and Italy offices are most advanced; UK and Germany are in early stages.
- Key challenge: Translating competency behaviors into culturally appropriate language.
- HR teams in smaller markets (Benelux, Nordics) have limited bandwidth.

Regional Manager's Concerns:
- "We need local HR champions, not a top-down mandate from Paris."
- "Training materials must be adapted — what 'Entrepreneurship' looks like in Milan differs from Munich."
- "Time pressure is real: Q3 is peak season, and pulling managers for training is tough."
- "Some brand HR leads are skeptical — they see this as Group HR overreach."

Rollout Plan Essentials:
- Phase 1 (Q1): Pilot in 2 brands × 2 regions → gather feedback.
- Phase 2 (Q2): Iterate based on pilot data; expand to remaining brands in pilot regions.
- Phase 3 (Q3-Q4): Full cascade across all 9 brands × all regions.
- Delivery Method: Interactive workshops (2 days) delivered by local HR with Group HR support.
- Train-the-Trainer: Regional HR leads attend a 3-day certification program.

Change Risks & Mitigation:
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Brand identity dilution | Customizable competency language per brand |
| Low manager buy-in | CEO-level sponsorship communications |
| Survey fatigue | Cap 360° frequency at once per year |
| Data privacy concerns | GDPR-compliant platform; clear consent flows |
| Inconsistent coaching quality | Standardized coach certification + supervision |

KPI Framework:
- Leading: % of leaders completing 360° (target: 85%), # coaching sessions delivered.
- Lagging: Internal promotion rate, inter-brand mobility rate, engagement score delta.
- Reporting Cadence: Monthly dashboards to CHRO; quarterly exec summary to CEO.
